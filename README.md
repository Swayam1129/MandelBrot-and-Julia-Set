**Mandelbrot and Julia Set Visualization**
#Overview
This project visualizes the Mandelbrot Set and Julia Sets using recursive fractal sequences. These fractals are generated using C programming and output in PPM (Portable Pixmap) format. The program allows for the exploration of these famous mathematical sets, providing beautiful and intricate patterns that reveal the complexity of fractals.

#Features
Visualizes the Mandelbrot Set and Julia Sets.
Outputs fractal images in PPM format.
Recursive generation of fractals with adjustable parameters for zoom and iterations.
Supports command-line input for easy configuration of fractal properties.

#Prerequisites
C Compiler: Ensure you have a working C compiler like GCC.
Make: (Optional) If you want to compile using a Makefile.
Basic knowledge of fractals and how to run C programs on the terminal.
